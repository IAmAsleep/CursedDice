        <h2>What is a TTRPG?</h2>
        <p> Also known as a pen-and-paper role-playing game, is a classification for a role-playing game (RPG) in which
            the participants describe their characters' actions through speech. Participants determine the actions of their 
            characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal system of rules 
            and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome 
            of the game. The terms pen-and-paper and tabletop are generally only used to distinguish
            this format of RPG from other formats, since neither pen and paper nor a table are strictly necessary.

        <p>Note: You can make a homebrew adventure</p>
        <p class="right-indent">To put it simply, homebrew is content that is made by people to share or for personal use. Anything that isnâ€™t official, published content (such as Curse of Strahd) that can be used in a game is considered homebrew. This covers adventures, classes, races, items, and more.
            Generally, homebrew creators create something new or make an addition to officially published material.</p>
